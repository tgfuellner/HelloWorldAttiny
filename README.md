Description:
------------

This project is a template for AVR microcontroller projects.
See http://stefanfrings.de/avr_hello_world/index.html

It provides a Makefile, serial console and system timer that counts milliseconds.

So this project works on ATtiny2313, Attiny4313, all ATmega and Xmega.

The HelloTiny project emulates a serial port by software. Can be used on all
ATtiny and ATmega controllers.
